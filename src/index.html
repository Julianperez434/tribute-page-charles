        <p id="tribute-info">Charles Babbage (1791-1871) was an English mathematician, philosopher, and inventor who is credited with designing the first mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
        <p> Babbage was born in London and studied at Cambridge University. He was interested in developing machines that could perform mathematical calculations automatically and accurately.</p>
        <p>Although he was never able to complete the construction of the Analytical Engine during his lifetime, his work laid the foundation for the development of modern computers.</p>
